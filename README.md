Sales Forecasting and Anomaly Detection Using Power BI
Problem Statement

The problem addressed in this project is to analyze historical sales data to predict future sales trends and identify unusual patterns or anomalies that may impact business performance. Organizations often rely on static reports that explain what happened but fail to anticipate future demand or detect sudden spikes and drops in sales. Challenges include handling time-series data, identifying seasonality, detecting unexpected deviations, and presenting insights in a clear and actionable manner.

Solution

The solution involves leveraging Python for data cleaning and preprocessing, SQL for structured data storage and analytical querying, and Power BI for forecasting, anomaly detection, and visualization.

The raw sales dataset is cleaned and transformed using Python, then converted into a CSV format and imported into a SQL database. SQL queries are used to aggregate sales metrics, analyze trends, and prepare time-based summaries. Power BI is used as the primary analytics and visualization tool, utilizing its built-in forecasting and anomaly detection capabilities to uncover future trends and unexpected behaviors in sales data.

This repository showcases the Sales Forecasting and Anomaly Detection project, which focuses on predictive analytics and advanced business intelligence using Power BI.
